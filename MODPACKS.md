# Modpacks
Modpacks, usually archived in a .zip form containing mod metadatas, are mods usually "duct taped" together to bring modded Minecraft in a more convenient way rather than handpicking mods one by one.

Popular examples of these can be found on the [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks) website.

These are modpacks made specially for PojavLauncher to improve it's overall performance. Being specially made for PojavLauncher doesn't mean you can't try it on PC though!

## Installing Modpacks
⚠️ There is NO modpack installer in the launcher itself. Won't be getting added either.
