# Modpacks
Modpacks, usually archived in a .zip form containing mod metadatas, are mods usually "duct taped" together to bring modded Minecraft in a more convenient way rather than handpicking mods one by one.

Popular examples of these can be found on both the [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpacks) and the [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks) website.

## Official Modpacks from PojavLauncherTeam
* [PojavOptimize (crystall1nedev, Chuck_Norris_)](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavOptimize) - A collection of mods to improve the performance and user experience.
* [PojavOptimize (GaucovyAero)](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/6p1xqhmmihf7x/PojavOptimize) - For maximum FPS, this modpack ships with the lowest settings possible.

These modpacks are specially made for PojavLauncher, but it doesn't mean you can't try them on PC too!
