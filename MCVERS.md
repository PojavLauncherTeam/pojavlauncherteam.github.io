# Supported Minecraft versions

With each new Minecraft release comes the question: *Will it play nice with PojavLauncher?*

Thanks to the hard work from PojavLauncherTeam, both the Android and the iOS port now cover most Minecraft versions...

...with some small exceptions that will be listed below.

## Android
Current issues, as of the Foxglove update:

## iOS
Current issues, as of the v2.2 Deepslate update:

 - v2.2 Deepslate will not open versions of minecraft past 1.20 (*)
 - v2.2 Deepslate does not have Java 21. (*)

(*) - To fix these issues, please use [the most recent github actions developer build](https://nightly.link/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/workflows/development/main/net.kdt.pojavlauncher-ios.ipa.zip).
