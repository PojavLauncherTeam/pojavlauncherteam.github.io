# Is PojavLauncher legal and safe to use?

Although in the past it may have not been the case, PojavLauncher is now legal in Microsoft's perspective. This is due to our objective to prevent piracy with our launcher, and reject offering support by any means for those who do not own the game.

PojavLauncher also abides by the Minecraft EULA, providing a free and open-source launcher that does not redistribute game files on any other server asides Mojang's. 

Authentication and downloads are performed directly with Mojang's servers--PojavLauncher never collects any of your personal information such as credentials or data, as your information is only stored on-device where only you can access it. 

PojavLauncher does not cause harm to your device, and does not distribute harmful programs and executables.
* This cannot be verified if you acquire PojavLauncher from a source that is not official(e.g. pgyer.com, ipaomtk.com, etc.).
* For jailbroken iOS users: jailbreaking can be considered a security risk (which is the reason why Apple is against it) so be cautious when jailbroken.
* Other Minecraft: Java Edition on Android/iOS apps highly likely steals assets and/or code from PojavLauncher. **They are not owned nor managed by PojavLauncherTeam.**
