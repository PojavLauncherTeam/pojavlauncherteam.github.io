# Can't log in

To fix your issues with login, try logging into minecraft.net first, sometimes just logging into the site fixes the issue. If that does not fix it, check these things:

a) you must own Minecraft: Java Edition
b) you must have a username set (check this if you are using Xbox Game Pass)
c) your account should not be a child member of a family, playing Minecraft like this only works on the official Minecraft Launcher for PC.
d) if the error is different and links you somewhere, try following any steps on the site it links you to
