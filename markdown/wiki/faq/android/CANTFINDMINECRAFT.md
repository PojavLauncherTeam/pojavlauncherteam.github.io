# Can't find .minecraft (non-root)
As with the log file, there are mutiple ways to do this.

## Android 10 and newer

  **/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch/files/.minecraft**

1. Install [Files by Marc apps & software](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marc.files) from Play Store.
2. Press the 3 dots in the top right corner → **Show hidden files**
3. Press the 3 lines in the top left corner → PojavLauncher → .minecraft

If PojavLauncher does not appear in the 3 lines menu, try closing (or opening) Pojav. If that doesn't work, try restarting your phone.
You can also use [ZArchiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver) (or [MiXplorer](https://mixplorer.com/)) with [Shizuku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api&hl=en_US) to access it.


## Android 9 and older

  **/storage/emulated/0/games/PojavLauncher/.minecraft**

All file managers can access this directory. [ZArchiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver) and [MiXplorer](https://mixplorer.com/) are recommended.
