# "There was a problem while parsing the package" error while installing

Google Chrome may corrupt the installation of PojavLauncher. Instead of Chrome, use [Firefox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox) or [Brave](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser).

Alternatively, you can use [Split APKs Installer (SAI)](https://github.com/Aefyr/SAI) if you would like to check the error message. (Most default installers do not show the installation error message)
