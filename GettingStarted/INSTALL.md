## iOS
Instructions for installing PojavLauncher on Apple devices.

::: details Sideloading (TrollStore)
We recommend TrollStore for all users if possible. This method allows for automatic JIT enabling, more memory allocation, and non-revoking installs.

1. Follow the steps to install [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore).
    - TrollStore is compatible with the following iOS versions:
        - 14.0 to 15.4.1
        - 15.5 beta 1 to 15.5 beta 4
        - 15.6 beta 1 to 15.6 beta 5

2. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/releases/latest/download/net.kdt.pojavlauncher.ipa).
    - For a specific release, you can find its package on the [Releases](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/releases) page

3. Locate where the .ipa was downloaded, tap the Share icon, and choose TrollStore in the list of options available.

You can now enjoy Minecraft: Java Edition on your iDevice!
:::

::: details Sideloading (Unjailbroken)
**Requires an active Apple ID, that has signed into the [Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account) at least once.**

PojavLauncher supports being sideloaded with AltStore, Sideloadly, and Xcode. Instructions to use AltStore are below--for other options, refer to their documentation.

1. Follow the official guide on installing AltStore itself:
    - Instructions for [Mac](https://faq.altstore.io/getting-started/how-to-install-altstore-macos) and [Windows](https://faq.altstore.io/getting-started/how-to-install-altstore-windows)
    
2. Install the latest release using this [Install with AltStore](altstore://install?url=https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/releases/latest/download/net.kdt.pojavlauncher.ipa) button.
    - For a specific release, you can find its button on the [Releases](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/releases) page

Installing PojavLauncher is not the end for iOS devices. In order to play Minecraft itself, you will need to [enable JIT](./JIT.md).
:::

::: details Sideloading (Jailbroken)
**Currently, AppSync Unified is not supported.** There is an [issue](https://github.com/akemin-dayo/AppSync/issues/108) regarding the data directory when installed with AppSync.

You can follow the `Sideloading (TrollStore)` or `Sideloading (Unjailbroken)` steps to sideload on a jailbroken iDevice. Regardless of the method, you will benefit from automatic JIT enabling and more memory allocation.
